# Writing an interpreter for the monkey language.
This is going to be an interpreter written in go for the monkey  programming language.
It is based on Thorsten Ball's book [Writing An Interpreter in GO](https://interpreterbook.com/).

## Why I am doing it 
My primary goal here is to learn more about programming languages, because I use one or the other every day.
I have written a simple compiler in university, but never an interpreter and book presents new ideas, such as Pratt's parsing (a cool [article](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2011/03/19/pratt-parsers-expression-parsing-made-easy/) on that) in a clear and understandable manner.

My secondary goal is to get more familiar with the [GO](https://go.dev/) programming language. It sparks a lot of interest in me, even though I cannot quite explain why for now. 

## Plans
I plan to finish the book first, and finilise notes after, to have a broader understanding what part each module plays in the interpreter.
